unutil.h
========

A file to go alongside util.h

unutil.h is a small humorous endeavor together with college roommate [Lucas Garron](http://www.garron.net). It's what the name suggests: a file full of (mostly) useless functions, such as `memdntcpy()` (inspired by `memcpy()`), and `itoi()` and `atoa()` (inspired by `atoi()` and `itoa()`).
